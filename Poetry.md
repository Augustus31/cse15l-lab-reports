## **Ode to the Garden**  
<br>
<br>
When times were hard, and spirits low,  

The garden stood, awash in glow  

Its flowers there to give support  

Against Ms.Hallfordâ€™s painful blow.  

<br>
<br>

Come rain or shine, come hail or gale,  

The garden stood, umbrellas up  

It called us in, it gave us warmth  

A tranquil peace, and no cleanup.  

<br>
<br>

When covid raged from state to state,  

The garden stood, free of the curse  

A sanctuary it was for us  

And well deserving of this verse.  

<br>
<br>

Though now we leave, this time for good  

Its memories are much like wood  

Still growing deep inside our souls  

The tree of life, eternal scrolls.
